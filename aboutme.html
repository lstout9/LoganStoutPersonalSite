      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Logan Stout, currently interning at WebBank as a Financial Data Specialist. 
        I'm a student at Utah State University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information 
        Systems with an emphasis in Data Engineering, and I'm also pursuing a dual major in Finance. 
        My dedication to both fields is reflected in my 3.7 GPA, even while working an average of 30 
        hours a week. I am excited to say that I will be completing my degrees in December!</p>

        <p>My education has fueled my passion for data and programming, prompting me to explore a wide range 
          of tools and technologies, including Python, SQL, Alteryx, Tableau, UiPath, Power BI, PowerApps, 
          PowerAutomate, and Snowflake.</p>
        
        <p>My previous experiences have been diverse and enriching. At Koch Agronomic and Energy Solutions, 
          I worked as an Analyst, where I automated processes, developed applications for sales teams, and 
          analyzed opportunity costs while contributing to the company's daily operations.</p>
        
        <p>My dedication extends beyond the professional realm. I've also volunteered as a Full-Time 
          Volunteer at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Dominican Republic. There, I 
          honed my leadership skills and collaborated with various communities, serving people from diverse 
          backgrounds and cultures. </p>
        
        <p>My true passion lies in the world of data. I'm excited to continue my journey of skill development,
           in a career that will allow me to do so. I'm eager to collaborate with seasoned professionals and 
           learn from their experiences. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!</p></p>
